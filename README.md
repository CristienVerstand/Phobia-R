The purpose of this desktop software is to have the possibility to send requests through a protocol chosen by the user and through the syntax expected from it.
This allows the user to have control over the means of communication and thus be able to test possible cases related to programming and computer network.

## About this software

Currently, the development of this software is in its **infancy**, so for now it only has these accessible protocols:

- HTTP/HTTPS

### Prerequisites??

This software has as a technical feature that you don't want to have dependencies

### Installing

You can compile it and edit it through visual studio, otherwise you could use any other software that does the same job.

## How to use

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/gZFkaL6.png "Phobia-R logo")

It is as simple as burning a church in norway.

In the texbox on your left is inserted the input that includes a format related to the chosen protocol (Currently only the HTTP protocol is available). 

Once the request is built press the right arrow to send the request, once the response is received it will be brutally spit into the textbox on the right.

Easy right?
